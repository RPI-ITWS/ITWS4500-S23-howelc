This lab was fairly easy and straight forward, considering I did a similar thing for my lab 4 last semester. I used the NYT API this time, as I was able to easily get 200 articles for the news ticker. I focused on details and design, as I had quite a bit time to spend on those areas. The app is fully mobile compatible. I wrote JavaScript functions to change data, my favorite of which is the getTimeSinceUpload() function, as it required the most amount of thinking and effort. Overall, this was a fun first lab to start the semester with.

UPDATE:

I got bored so I decided to add a category switcher. I just added some buttons with event listeners that will change the category. That is it.


This is the spec sheet: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t4QVDyd5O7oRYpNg5ixT04BXFFHz0NY5S75Kp7NlddU/edit?usp=sharing

I followed the spec sheet but change some formatting to look better (in my opinion) but for the most part it is similar to the wireframe.
