In the process of creating my wind data app using the MERN stack, I utilized several resources to access data, manage dependencies, and style the frontend. Here's a personalized account of the steps I took to develop the app:

    Project setup and planning: I started by identifying the APIs and data sources I would need for my app, which included:
        NASA POWER API (https://power.larc.nasa.gov/)
        Census API (https://api.census.gov/)
        EIA API (https://api.eia.gov/)
        US States FIPS codes Gist (https://gist.github.com/wavded/1250983/bf7c1c08f7b1596ca10822baeb8049d7350b0a4b)
        US Counties FIPS codes Gist (https://gist.github.com/JoshuaCarroll/54ee2090e79fe3b261ae42aea9b999b2)
        FIPS to Latitude/Longitude JSON (https://github.com/josh-byster/fips_lat_long/blob/master/fips_map.json)

    Initialize the project: I created a new folder for my project and initialized a new Node.js project using npm init. I also installed Yarn, an alternative package manager, using npm install -g yarn.

    Backend setup:
    a. I installed Express and other necessary packages using yarn add express mongoose cors dotenv.
    b. I created an index.js file to set up the server using Express.
    c. I configured the server to use middleware, such as CORS (for cross-origin requests) and express.json() (for parsing JSON request bodies).
    d. I set up routes to handle API requests.
    e. I connected to MongoDB using the mongoose package and created a schema for the wind data. I used MongoDB Compass to visualize the data and manage my database.
    f. I implemented the logic for fetching wind data from external APIs, processing it, and storing it in MongoDB.

    Frontend setup:
    a. I used Vite to set up a new React project in a separate folder within my project.
    b. I installed additional packages needed for my frontend, such as react-router-dom for routing, using yarn add react-router-dom.
    c. I created the necessary components for my app, such as a search form, a map or chart for displaying wind data, and a table for displaying detailed information.
    d. I implemented state management using React hooks to store and manage wind data across components.
    e. I implemented API calls to my backend server using the Fetch API to fetch wind data and store it in my frontend state.
    f. I styled my components using CSS and react-bootstrap, which I installed using yarn add react-bootstrap bootstrap.
    g. I implemented data visualization using the react-chartjs-2 package, which I installed using yarn add react-chartjs-2 chart.js.

    Testing and debugging: I tested my app thoroughly by simulating user interactions and checking for errors in the console. I used browser developer tools to inspect elements, network requests, and app state.

    Deployment: I deployed my app to an Azure VM. For the backend, I set up environment variables for sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials. For the frontend, I created a production build using yarn build and deployed it to the Azure VM.
